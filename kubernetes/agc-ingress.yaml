  # You should upload a certificate to your Kubernetes platform and refer to it here by secretName.
  # If you do not want to serve AGC over TLS, you can remove or comment out the
  # kubernetes.io/ingress.allow-http annotation above and the tls section below.
  # Note that raw (unencrypted) WebSockets may not work if you are behind a corporate proxy so
  # it is advised that you provide a cert for production and access the AGC service via https:// and wss://
